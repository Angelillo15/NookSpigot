Subject: [PATCH] Optimise non-flush packet sending

Places like entity tracking make heavy use of packet sending,
and internally netty will use some very expensive thread wakeup
calls when scheduling.

Thanks to various hacks in ProtocolLib as well as other
plugins, we cannot simply use a queue of packets to group
send on execute. We have to call execute for each packet.

Tux's suggestion here is exactly what was needed - tag
the Runnable indicating it should not make a wakeup call.

Big thanks to Tux for making this possible as I had given
up on this optimisation before he came along.

Locally this patch drops the entity tracker tick by a full 1.5x.
